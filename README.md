Code regarding data filtering using a machine learning approach.

AstroQuest is an online citizen science project undertaken by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, WA.

It takes a crowd-sourcing approach and asks regular folk to get involved and help the scientists with their research work. The citizen scientists are inspecting images of galaxies and helping Australian astronomers with their research into how galaxies grow and evolve

Unfortunately, some of the data is unusable because of:
1.	Data errors
2.	User errors
3.	Malicious users 

This project is to develop a Machine Learning system to scan all the images (70,000+) looking for bad images and removing them from the dataset.
